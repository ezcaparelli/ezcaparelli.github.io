# Simple Website Starter (HTML + CSS)

A clean, single-page, responsive website you can deploy for **free** on GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
2. Create a new repository named **`yourusername.github.io`** (replace with your GitHub username).
3. Upload `index.html`, `styles.css`, and the `assets/` folder to the repository root.
4. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io` to see it live.
5. (Optional) Add a custom domain by creating a `CNAME` file in the repo root that contains only your domain (e.g., `example.com`). Then configure your DNS as described below.

## Custom domain (optional)
- In your DNS provider, create **CNAME** records pointing your domain or subdomain to `yourusername.github.io`.
- For apex domains (e.g., `example.com`) GitHub recommends **A** records pointing to GitHub Pages IPs and an **ALIAS/ANAME** if supported. See GitHub Docs.
- Commit a `CNAME` file with your domain to enable HTTPS for that domain.

## Editing
Open `index.html` and replace texts like **Acme Solutions**, email, WhatsApp, and services with your details. Adjust colors in `styles.css` if you wish.

## License
Free to use and modify.
